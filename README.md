Tkier App 

This Python application uses Tkinter to display desktop notifications that regularly remind the user to drink water. Every hour, a popup window appears on the screen asking if the user has had water recently. 

Features 

Simple GUI notification using Tkinter 

Automatic hourly reminders 

Popup window visible for 5 seconds 

Eye-catching design with emoji and large font 

How It Works 

When the app starts, the main window is hidden. 

A popup window appears every hour. 

The window automatically closes after 5 seconds. 


Notes 

The app runs in the background; the main window is hidden. 

Notifications only work in desktop environments (systems with GUI support).
